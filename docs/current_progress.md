# Current Progress & Debugging (Input System)

## Status as of Last Test:

- **Initialization:**
    - `js/webinput.js` system initializes.
    - Example project's `main.js` initializes and calls Wasm `_start`.
    - Animation loop for `update_frame` in Zig is running.
- **Keyboard Input:**
    - `keydown` and `keyup` events are successfully captured by `js/webinput.js`.
    - These events are successfully calling the `zig_internal_on_key_event` function in `src/webinput.zig`.
    - This indicates that the FFI bridge for key events is functional.
- **Mouse Input:**
    - **ISSUE:** No log messages related to mouse clicks, mouse movement (after the initial corrected one), or mouse wheel are appearing from `js/webinput.js` or subsequently from `src/webinput.zig` or `example/src/input_handler.zig`.
    - The initial "Mouse moved" log on startup has been fixed in `example/src/input_handler.zig`.
- **`example/src/input_handler.zig`:**
    - Contains logic to detect and log left mouse button presses and spacebar presses.

## Current Hypothesis for Mouse Input Issue:

The primary suspect for the lack of mouse input is that the JavaScript event listeners for mouse events (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `wheel`) are not being correctly attached or are not firing. This is most likely due to an issue with the `canvas` element in `js/webinput.js`:
1.  The canvas element specified by `canvasElementOrId` (expected to be `'zigCanvas'`) might not exist in the example project's HTML, or its ID might be different.
2.  The canvas element might exist but might not be interactive (e.g., zero size, hidden, or obscured by other elements).

Keyboard events work because they are attached globally to `window`, which doesn't rely on a specific canvas element being found.

## Next Steps & Plan:

1.  **Verify Canvas Element in Example HTML:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure the example project's main HTML file (e.g., `example/web/index.html` or similar) contains a valid `<canvas id="zigCanvas"></canvas>` element.
    *   **Check:** Confirm this HTML file is being correctly served and rendered by the browser.
    *   **Verify:** Use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM and confirm the canvas element with `id="zigCanvas"` is present and has non-zero dimensions.

2.  **Re-Test with Full Diagnostic Logs in `js/webinput.js`:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure the version of `js/webinput.js` with the detailed temporary `console.log` statements (as provided in the previous debugging session) is active in the example project.
    *   **Test:** Run the example and specifically perform mouse actions (move over the canvas, click buttons, use the wheel).
    *   **Observe Logs:**
        *   Look for `"[WebInput.js TEMP] JS mouse..."` messages. Their absence for mouse actions would confirm the JS listeners aren't firing.
        *   If they *do* fire, check if `"[WebInput.js TEMP] zig_internal_on_mouse_... IS available. Calling."` appears, followed by `"Zig: zig_internal_on_mouse_... called."`.

3.  **If Mouse JS Listeners Still Don't Fire (After Verifying Canvas):**
    *   **In `js/webinput.js` -> `setupInputSystem`:** Add a log *after* `canvas = document.getElementById(canvasElementOrId);` to print the `canvas` variable itself. `console.log("[WebInput.js TEMP] Canvas element found by getElementById:", canvas);` This will show if `getElementById` is returning `null` or the actual element.
    *   **In `js/webinput.js` -> `_setupMouseListeners`:** Add a log at the very start: `console.log("[WebInput.js TEMP] Attempting to setup mouse listeners. Canvas object:", canvas);`

4.  **If Mouse JS Listeners Fire but Zig Functions Not Reached:**
    *   This would indicate an issue with `wasmExports` or the specific `zig_internal_on_mouse_...` Wasm exports. The detailed logs for this case in `js/webinput.js` (logging `wasmExports` on failure) should reveal this.

5.  **Once Mouse Events Reach Zig:**
    *   Verify that `example/src/input_handler.zig` correctly logs `"[InputHandler] Left mouse button just pressed!"` etc.
    *   Verify that `example/src/main.zig` can then use the `input_handler` getters to also react to these events.

6.  **Cleanup:**
    *   Remove all temporary diagnostic logs from `js/webinput.js` and `src/webinput.zig` once all input types are confirmed working.
